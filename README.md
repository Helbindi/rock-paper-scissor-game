## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

For this project, I learned to utilize the Reducer and Context hooks to manage the state of my game. Another part that was tricky for me was determining the best way to transition the Roshambo game logic into code.
